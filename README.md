Hello, I'm Layne!

I'm primarily a frontend web dev; currently working on my first full stack project.
I write HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and little bit of Powershell. I'm familiar with Rust, but by no means an expert.

- Most of my experience is with `electron` and `discord.js`; learning `supabase` at the moment.
  - I tried `tauri` before I learned Rust which didn't go well
- I'm a vanilla JS lover, but I want to learn Svelte.
  - I probably should also learn how to use Sass...
  - ...and Deno or Bun...
- I have a little bit of networking experience, working with Extreme and Avaya switches

Unfortunately I'm a little unmotivated at the moment, but I still try to stay up-to-date with new technologies. Open to learn anything (as long as it's not `tailwind`)
